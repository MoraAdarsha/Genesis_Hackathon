# Proactive Network Congestion Prediction & Bandwidth Management (Smart Network Optimization for Enhanced Connectivity)

This project implements a machine learning system to proactively predict network congestion on a set of routers and provide automated, actionable recommendations for bandwidth allocation. It leverages XGBoost models trained on time-series network data to forecast congestion probabilities and drive a rule-based recommendation engine.



## Approach (baseline)

- Supervised **classification** for *congestion in next interval*: features include traffic volume, latency, bandwidth used/allocated, utilization ratio, time-of-day/week, lags, number of users, application usage and many more.
- Simple **reallocation policy**: shift bandwidth from underutilized to overutilized devices/links based on predicted risk and a utilization threshold.



---

###  Project Goal

The primary objective is to move from a reactive to a **proactive** network management strategy. By anticipating congestion before it occurs, the system aims to:
-   Improve network performance and reliability.
-   Optimize resource allocation by adjusting bandwidth dynamically.
-   Reduce manual intervention and operational overhead.

###  System Architecture & Data Pipelines

The project is built around two distinct data pipelines to ensure robust development, testing, and validation:

1.  **Pipeline P (Processed Data)** 
    * **Source:** Raw, historical log files from problem statement itself.
    * **Process:** The `cleaning_given_data.ipynb` notebook ingests, cleans, merges, and features-engineers this data.
    * **Output:** `model_ready_dataset_p.csv`. This dataset represents the merged data of all the different raw files that were given.

2.  **Pipeline G (Generated Data)** 
    * **Source:** Synthetically generated from scratch.
    * **Process:** The `dataset_generator.ipynb` notebook creates a clean, well-structured dataset with realistic, simulated network patterns (e.g., peak business hours, evening usage spikes).
    * **Output:** `model_ready_dataset_g.csv`. This dataset provides a controlled environment for model testing and serves as a performance baseline.

---

###  Notebooks

This repository contains the following notebooks, which form the core of the project.

#### ### 1.  `cleaning_given_data.ipynb`

This notebook handles the entire ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for the real-world data pipeline.

* **Purpose**: To process and merge multiple raw data sources into a single, model-ready dataset.
* **Inputs**:
    * `Router_A_router_log_15_days.csv`
    * `Router_B_router_log_15_days.csv`
    * `Router_C_router_log_15_days.csv`
    * `application_usage.csv`
    * `user_activity.csv`
    * `external_factors.csv`
    * `configuration_history.csv`
* **Key Steps**:
    1.  **Load & Consolidate**: Loads all raw CSVs and combines the individual router logs.
    2.  **Aggregate**: Computes daily summaries from detailed logs (e.g., `total_peak_app_traffic`, `total_logins`, `Num_Config_Changes`).
    3.  **Merge & Clean**: Merges all data frames on `Date` and/or `Device Name` and fills any resulting `NaN` values.
    4.  **Export**: Saves the final, sorted dataset as `final_model_ready_dataset.csv`.

#### ### 2.  `dataset_generator.ipynb`

This notebook generates a high-quality, synthetic dataset for controlled model training and evaluation.

* **Purpose**: To synthetically generate a complete and realistic dataset that mimics real-world network behavior.
* **Key Steps**:
    1.  **Simulate Router Logs**: Generates hourly log data, programmatically increasing traffic and latency to simulate **peak business hours** and **evening usage spikes**.
    2.  **Simulate Daily Summaries**: Creates synthetic daily data for application usage, user activity, and external events (e.g., outages, maintenance).
    3.  **Integrate & Model Events**: Merges all synthetic data and simulates the impact of events (e.g., doubling latency during a network outage).
    4.  **Create Target Variable**: Applies a rule-based function (`create_new_flag`) to label congestion events.
    5.  **Export**: Saves the final dataset as `new_realistic_dataset_v2.csv`.

Of course. Here is a more detailed breakdown of the machine learning and recommendation components from the `model+recommendation` notebooks, formatted for your README file.

### ### 3. The Model & Recommendation Engine

The `model+recommendation_p.ipynb` and `model+recommendation_g.ipynb` notebooks are the heart of this project. They execute a sophisticated workflow to move from historical data to future predictions and actionable advice. Here’s a detailed look at each stage.

#### **1. Feature Engineering: The Sliding Window**

To predict the future, the model must understand the recent past. This is achieved using a **sliding window** approach, which transforms the time-series data into a format that a classification model can understand.

* **Concept**: To predict congestion for a specific hour (let's call it `T`), the model analyzes the network's behavior over the **previous 12 hours** (from `T-12` to `T-1`). This 12-hour block is the "window."
* **Vector Construction**: The function `create_training_samples` flattens this 12-hour window into a single, comprehensive feature vector. It takes 9 key metrics (like `Traffic Volume`, `Latency`, `Bandwidth Used`, `total_logins`, etc.) for each of the 3 routers at each of the 12 hours.
* **Result**: This process creates one training sample with a feature vector of size $12 \text{ hours} \times 3 \text{ routers} \times 9 \text{ metrics} = 324$ features. This vector provides a rich, time-aware snapshot of the network's state leading up to a potential congestion event.

#### **2. Model Training: A Multi-Model Strategy**

Instead of a single, general-purpose model, this project uses a more effective, specialized approach.

* **Algorithm**: The core algorithm is the **XGBoost Classifier**, a powerful gradient-boosting model known for its high accuracy and ability to capture complex, non-linear relationships in data.
* **Specialized Models**: Three independent XGBoost models are trained—one for each router (`Router_A`, `Router_B`, and `Router_C`). This **multi-model strategy** allows each model to become an expert on its assigned device, learning its unique traffic patterns and congestion triggers far more effectively than a single "one-size-fits-all" model could.

#### **3. Prediction: From Data to Probability**

The `predict_congestion_proba` function operationalizes the trained models, turning historical data into a forward-looking risk assessment.

* **Input**: A target timestamp for which a prediction is needed.
* **Process**: The function automatically constructs the 12-hour feature vector preceding the target time.
* **Output**: It returns a **congestion probability** for each router—a precise score between 0.0 (no risk) and 1.0 (very high risk). This probabilistic output is more valuable than a simple "yes/no" prediction because it quantifies the level of risk.

#### **4. Recommendation Engine: From Probability to Action**

The `bandwidth_recommendation` function acts as the final decision-logic layer, translating the model's risk scores into concrete, actionable advice. It uses a decision matrix that weighs both the **congestion probability** and the current **bandwidth utilization**.

* **CRITICAL (`prob >= 0.8`)**: The risk of congestion is imminent.
    * **Action**: `increase_bandwidth`. The amount is aggressive (+25% to +40%) to prevent an outage.
* **MODERATE RISK (`prob >= 0.6`)**: The system is showing signs of strain.
    * **Action**: `increase_bandwidth` (+20%) if utilization is also high, otherwise `monitor_closely`.
* **PREVENTIVE (`prob >= 0.4`)**: A proactive adjustment may be needed if the network is busy.
    * **Action**: A small `increase_bandwidth` (+10%) is recommended only if utilization is already high (>85%).
* **OPTIMIZE (`prob <= 0.2`)**: The risk is very low, indicating potential over-provisioning.
    * **Action**: If utilization is also low (<40%), `decrease_bandwidth` (-15%) to improve efficiency and reduce costs.
* **STABLE/NORMAL (all other cases)**: The network is operating within acceptable parameters.
    * **Action**: `maintain` current allocation or `monitor` for changes.

##  Proactive Network Congestion Dashboard
In dashboard directory there is the python script of streamlit application, which defines the dashboard of project over streamlit, utilizing the models in the corresponding directories.

-----

###  Input: What the Dashboard Needs

To function correctly, the application requires two main types of input: a primary dataset and pre-trained machine learning assets.

#### 1\. Primary Data Source

The core input is a **time-series dataset** of network metrics, typically in a CSV file (or a Pandas DataFrame). This dataset must contain the following columns for the feature engineering process to work:

  * `Timestamp`: The date and time of the data record (datetime object).
  * `Device Name`: The identifier for the network device (e.g., 'Router\_A', 'Router\_B').
  * `Traffic Volume (MB/s)`: The volume of traffic passing through the device.
  * `Latency (ms)`: The network latency at that time.
  * `Bandwidth Used (MB/s)`: The amount of bandwidth currently in use.
  * `Bandwidth Allocated (MB/s)`: The total bandwidth allocated to the device.
  * `total_avg_app_traffic`: A feature representing the average application traffic.
  * `total_peak_app_traffic`: A feature representing the peak application traffic.
  * `Impact_encoded`: A **numerical** representation of congestion impact (e.g., 0 for 'None', 1 for 'Low', etc.).
  * `total_peak_user_usage`: A feature for peak usage by users.
  * `total_logins`: The total number of logins.

#### 2\. Pre-trained Machine Learning Assets

The application relies on assets generated from a separate model training process.

  * **XGBoost Models:** For each router (`A`, `B`, `C`), a pre-trained XGBoost model must be saved as a `.pkl` file using `joblib`. These files should be named `modelA_p.pkl`, `modelB_p.pkl`, etc., and placed in a `models/` directory located one level above the script's folder.
  * **Label Encoder:** A fitted `LabelEncoder` object from scikit-learn, saved as `label_encoder_impact.pkl`. This is used to consistently transform the `Impact` feature. The code includes a fallback to create a default encoder if this file is missing.

-----

###  Output: What the Dashboard Provides

The dashboard processes the input data and produces two key outputs: numerical predictions and actionable recommendations.

#### 1\. Congestion Probabilities

For each router, the primary output of the machine learning model is a **congestion probability**. This is a floating-point number between `0.0` and `1.0`, where:

  * A value close to `0.0` indicates a **very low risk** of congestion.
  * A value close to `1.0` indicates a **very high risk** of congestion.

These probabilities are the core data points used for all subsequent analysis and recommendations.

#### 2\. Bandwidth Recommendations

The dashboard translates the raw probabilities into clear, human-readable recommendations for each router. The recommendation engine considers the congestion probability, current bandwidth utilization, and latency to generate a structured output containing:

  * **`action`**: A suggested course of action (e.g., `'increase_bandwidth'`, `'monitor_closely'`, `'decrease_bandwidth'`).
  * **`amount`**: The recommended change in bandwidth in MB/s. This will be positive for an increase and negative for a decrease.
  * **`reason`**: A plain-English explanation for the recommendation, providing context for the administrator (e.g., `'CRITICAL: High congestion probability (0.92) with 95% utilization'`).

-----

###  How It Visualizes Data

The dashboard uses the Plotly library to create three main interactive visualizations that allow for easy interpretation of the network's health.

#### 1\. Traffic Volume Over Time

This is a **line chart** that plots the `Traffic Volume (MB/s)` for each router over the selected time period.

  * **Purpose**: To show trends, patterns, and spikes in network traffic.
  * **Features**:
      * Each router is represented by a different colored line.
      * A **vertical dashed red line** is drawn on the chart to mark the specific "Prediction Point," giving crucial context to the other visualizations.

#### 2\. Congestion Probability (%)

This is a **bar chart** that provides an at-a-glance summary of the current congestion risk.

  * **Purpose**: To immediately identify which routers are at risk.
  * **Features**:
      * Each bar corresponds to a router, with the bar's height representing the predicted congestion probability (scaled to 100).
      * The bars are **dynamically color-coded** based on risk level:
          * **\<span style="color:green"\>■\</span\> Green:** Low risk (Probability \< 40%)
          * **\<span style="color:orange"\>■\</span\> Orange:** Medium risk (Probability 40% - 70%)
          * **\<span style="color:red"\>■\</span\> Red:** High risk (Probability \> 70%)

#### 3\. Current Bandwidth Utilization

This **bar chart** shows how efficiently the allocated bandwidth is being used for each router.

  * **Purpose**: To diagnose if high congestion is related to high resource usage.
  * **Features**:
      * Each bar shows the utilization percentage ($$\frac{\text{Bandwidth Used}}{\text{Bandwidth Allocated}} \times 100$$).
      * The bars are colored along a **continuous green-yellow-red gradient**, providing a smooth visual indicator of utilization levels.
